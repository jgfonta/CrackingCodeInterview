//2.5 Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns 
//node at the beginning of the loop.
//DEFINITION
//Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a node’s next pointer
//points to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list.
//EXAMPLE
//input: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier]
//output: C
