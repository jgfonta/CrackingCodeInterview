//Alternatively, we could do the following:
//1. Check every char of the string with every other char of the string for duplicate occurrences. This will take O(n^2) time and no space.
//2. If we are allowed to destroy the input string, we could sort the string in O(n log n) time and then linearly check the string for neighboring characters that are identical. Careful, though - many sorting algorithms take up extra space.
